Tetrecs
This repository contains a major coursework project for a module, representing 40% of the total module grade. The project involves building a fast-paced block placement game called TetrECS, similar to the popular game Tetris, but with a twist. The game is built using JavaFX and incorporates various concepts such as custom components, graphics and animation, listeners, properties and binding, communications, media, and file handling. The coursework is divided into sections, each focusing on a different aspect of the game development process, including game logic, user interface, events, graphics, game loop, scores, online scoreboard, and multiplayer functionality. An extension to include various language options was included.
